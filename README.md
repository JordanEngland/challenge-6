# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

Building a weather dashboard has been fun and challenging at the same to. some things ive learn is you'll need to use more then one API. that took me a little bit to realize and go back and really dig in on the documentation and figure out how to add the others to get it working correctly. it has been good to know that im able to start to create these type of projects now. in the future it'll get better with doing this more and more. another challenging part has been getting the weather icons to upload correctly. sometimes it seems to be working and other times it don'. all together a good and challenging project.
